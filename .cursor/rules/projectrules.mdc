🔒 Cursor AI Rules for Topcoder Member API Challenge
✅ General Guidelines
- Never break existing unit tests — all previously passing tests must continue to pass.

- Do not make assumptions — if a requirement is unclear, do not invent functionality. **Leave a TODO: Ask in chat instead.**

- No code linting errors — all code must pass the existing linter configuration.

- Maintain architectural integrity — follow the architecture used in member-api-v6.

- Keep code modular, clean, and well-documented — avoid duplication, follow DRY principles.

- Incoming stats/history objects follow these update rules:

    - If id is present → update the existing item.

    - If id is missing → create a new item.

    - If an existing item in DB is not in the request payload → delete that item from the DB.

- Do not allow deletion directly via DELETE endpoints (no delete endpoints allowed).

- Do not hardcode values — always validate incoming data using schema or DTOs.

- Every code / changes / modification must have clear explanation

- STRICLY Forbidden large code modification and generation

- ❌ Do not access or require AWS/VPN dependencies.

- ❌ Do not modify unrelated parts of the codebase unless necessary to support the new implementation.

- ❌ Do not create new frameworks or deviate from the current architecture unless approved.
